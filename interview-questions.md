# Question about me

## 1. Could you tell me about yourself and describe your background in brief?

I'm 26 years old. I'm from Chile. My former studies were in mining engineering because my country has an extensive mining industry. But I realized that my curiosity goes farther than just the mining field. However, I decided to continue my studies because I had a scholarship that didn't allow me to change of major. But, I took advantage of the focus on mathematics, statistics, and computer science ( in fact, I took the computer science minor). 

However to this decision, during the five and half years of my studies (I didn't take too much time, it's the minimum duration of an engineering degree in my country). I always study in parallel by myself, at first physics and chemistry, from books, videos, and extra curses, until the moment when I tried to automatize the play of a video game using python and auto clicks. That was my love at the first challenge. After this, I focused all my energy on this field.

Fur lucky, my cousin (and one of my best friends) is talented and passionate about computer science, and he was my guide for what I needed to learn. About the different fields of computer science, what is a programming language, what is the focus of each one, the different programming paradigms ( like object-oriented, functional, and imperative), the importance of control version systems, and of making a clean code, etc

Then, after practicing and studying a lot, I proposed my thesis to a company about applying image recognition and segmentation to geology. With this new method, we passed from hours of human work to just a couple of seconds and more consistent results. So, they contacted me, and I worked there for one year, working with image analysis, data analysis, management of databases, and similar things. 

Until I decided to start formal studies with the master of computer science, with the AI specialization, where I asked for a preparation year because I want to make stronger my skills, I preferred to take a little more time but have solid background knowledge. 

And now, I completed my first semester successfully, and I'm searching for a new challenge where I could be apport from my enthusiasm and effort

## 13. What is your greatest strength?
* The quick learner. I think that I'm used to it because I'm constantly studying different things. And I have demonstrated it. For example, when in a short time and under pressure, I had to learn and apply new technology to allow the faster processing of AI models on CPU.
* It's a combination between perseverance, optimism, and a love for being outside of my comfort zone. Until now, I reached long-term goals and things that looked so hard for someone from where I came, with parents only with high school, I studied in a public school, which is not the best in my country. But I achieved being one of the top 5 on my degree and won one of the fifteen scholarships for study in Hungary.  Where I was working for coming to Europe to study since I left the high school.

## 14. What is your greatest weakness?
I'm a little anxious, for example,  when I'm waiting for a test result. But for this reason, I tried to keep myself occupied. In this way, I avoid overthinking and I can move on with my other tasks. I also do sport and mind fullness meditation to relax. I like introspection, and when I find a lousy behavior, I try to fix it. 

## 9. Tell Me About a Time You Demonstrated Leadership Skills.
I was part of the student center at covid times in my university days. I formed a work team to manage student difficulties like the absence of internet connections, the necessity of a laptop for study, or problems with professors. I made a questionary for knowing the situation of all the mining faculty, estimating the necessary resources, and thus proposing a solution to the rector. We reached that our faculty gave scholarships to pay the internet of classmates with resources problem and that the university put to disposition computers to pass to some students during the pandemic.  I really liked the worked made 

## 11. Tell Me About a Time You Made a Mistake.
In one project I needed a GPU for the real-time processing of a model. My mistake was to start to develop the model without confirmation from the customer of the hardware disponibility because they said at the beginning that they can put what we would need. But almost at the final of my development, they said me that it was not possible, and they only have a CPU. So, I had to change the type of model and change the technologies used. In the beginning, I tried to manage this by myself, but I learned the power of communication, I told the problem to my boss and colleagues. With my boss, we talked with the customer and we update the new dates and my colleagues gave me advice for the new development. Finally, the project was delivered on the stipulated dates and with a good customer feedback

## 5. hen you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?
1. If it's possible, I like to measure the projects and tasks with my team on what is important and what is urgent. In this way, I can start with the most important and urgent things, and going fulfilling the rest according on this rank. 
2. In parallel, I like to put myself dates of fulfillment. Hopefully, less than final fulfill date, for what, in case of having any problem or delay, to be able to report it and take some measurements so as not to fail with the delivery of the product and not fail with the customer

## 2. What type of work environment do you prefer?
I prefer an environment of fellowship, where if someone has more knowledge of something, he or she shares it with the community, with the goal that all the team can improve and give a better service to the customer. When I know something that could be of help to someone, I'm really glad to share it, I'm not searching to be the first if this means stopping the growth of others.

## 3. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations? / tell me one situation where...
 1. When I just moved here was a little stressful, I didn't speak too much English and less Hungarian. The first time I had to make a lot of bureaucratic. So I first collected all the things in a list, and I put all requirements. While I tried to make a support network, I knew some Chilean people who had some information and advice. Meanwhile, I started to speak as much English I could to train. Now, fortunately, I'm more used to Hungary and expressing myself 
 2. In one moment in the middle of a project, the customers said that they couldn't provide the hardware requirement of a GPU, and I had to apply a technology that I didn't know at this time, to allow real-time processing of AI models on CPU. At first, I tried to manage this by myself, and I was so stressed working all my day. But after I learned the power of communication, I explained the situation to my boss, and we set new dates together with the customer. Thanks to my workmates' advice, I found the necessary technologies, which saved me a lot of work. Finally, I could fulfill all project's goals and with a good customer feedback

## 24. Which is your most significant accomplishment?
I think that be here, I never was good at English, and I really love my family, but I left my comfort zone, and I came here for at least three years. And of course, for won this scholarship I had to make a lot of efforts 

## 4. Do you prefer working independently or on a team?
Although working alone can be more agile, I like to work in a team, since much greater things can be done and you can learn from your colleagues

## 6. What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?
I'm constantly searching for new information and trying to be on a date with the advances. But in parallel to the general information, I was taking courses and tried to make my own projects. This year I meanly focused on improve my problem solving skills and incorporating essential things like Git and the handling of ubuntu 

## 7. What are your salary expectations?
I'm not here just for money, but a good salary would give me the opportunity of a better life and feel more comfortable. I would like at least 120 - 150k 

## 8. Why Are You Leaving Your Current Job?
Because I came to study a master in computer science. At the first, I had the opportunity of continuing working beside my studies, but I didn't want to take responsibilities without knowing if I could fulfill them and at this moment we had a gap of 6 hours, which made it harder. The first semester I spent a lot of time getting used to Hungary and making lines in governmental offices. But now I'm more confident and I'm ready to retake my work hours. 

## 12. Tell Me About a Challenge or Conflict You’ve Faced at Work, and How You Dealt With It.
I had a team leader who constantly attacked the proposals in my former work. In the beginning, it was a little awkward, but I learned to don't take it personally, and I found like a good idea because after this, always when I wanted to propose something, I prepared myself better to respond to any question, and it made me have a stronger aproach

## 15. Can You Explain Why You Changed Career Paths?
One of my life goals is to improve the quality of life of the people or support something to the humanity knowledge, and I think that computer science is a good and funny way to reach it

## 16. What Are You Looking for in a New Position?

## 17. How Would Your Boss and Coworkers Describe You?
Someone motivated and engaged with their work. I want to think that they find me funny too. I try to make more bearable moments, with a good sense of humor and good treatment of people. I like to remember that I'm talking with persons with feelings and an inside world. In this way, I can be more empathic 

## 18. What Motivates You?
Try to give others the opportunities that I had. If it wasn't for the support of my family and friends, I don't know if I would have come this far, and I'm aware that this is not common. For what motivates me to get to do something that improves people's lives

## 19. Where Do You See Yourself in Five Years?
Independent of where I'm or where I'm working, I look myself contributing to open-source projects to improve the quality of life of the people. 

## 20. How Do You Plan to Achieve Your Career Goals?
I will prepare myself to take advantage of the opportunities that life gives. And I will knock on all doors that I can to search for the opportunity to learn more and demonstrate what I can do 

## 22. What Should I Know That’s Not on Your Resume?
I trained athleticism for like 8 years, focused every day, where I learned the perseverance and the discipline 

## 26. What Is Your Greatest Professional Achievement?
Be able to apply a technology that I didn't know in a short time. It was a challenge of fast learning and stress management 

## 25. Why Should We Hire You? / What Can You Bring to the Company?

## 21. What’s Your Dream Job?

## 23. What Makes You Unique?

# Technical questions 

## What are your preferred programming languages and why?
Even if I like languages like C because I can know what is happening every time and it's so fast. I prefer python because it's a simple language, with libraries so useful for computer science, or whatever you want to do and have a strong community 

## What is a class? What is a super-class?
a. A class is a fundamental concept for Object-oriented programming. It's used for creating objects with specific values, states, and behaviors. 
b. A super-class is the parent class from the current class that inherit the features

## What is a default constructor? What is a conversion constructor?
a. A default constructor is which one is automated generated by the compiler in absence of any definition, usually, it doesn't need to be provided any argument
b. There are constructors that convert types of its parameter into a type of the class

## What is the difference between C and C++ ? Would you prefer to use one over the other?
a. C is a low-level language, mainly a procedural that supports structured programming. However, C++ high-level language, a multi-paradigm, which supports object-oriented programming 
b. C is preferred when the speed and performance is really crucial, and C++ when you need speed but also others features like the object-oriented paradigm 

## What is multiple inheritance? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
* 1. Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class.
* 2.1. Advantages:  simple, clear, and more conducive to reuse. It won't change the code in a big way because of a small change in the base class.
* 2.2. Disadvantages: ambiguity, Diamond Of Death Tree, can bring problem when you use parent class pointer to point to the subclass object. Do you need to use dynamic_cast, which is also troublesome. This can fall in a performance loss

## What is the computer system?
A computer system is a combination of memory, CPU, peripheral devices that are connected to it, and OS (Operating System).

## List out components of a computer system
* CPU (Central Processing Unit) including control unit and arithmetic logic unit
* Memory like primary and secondary
* Input and output devices like keyboard mouse, printer scanner, etc.

## What is a microprocessor?
A microprocessor is an integrated circuit having all the functionality of a central processing unit of a PC.

## Explain class variable
In object-oriented programming with classes, a class variable is any variable declared with the static modifier of which a single copy exists, regardless of how many instances of the class exist

## What is SDLC?
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces quality software products in less time. The stages involve by SDLC are: 1) planning, 2) design, 4) construction, 5) testing, and 6) deployment.

## Explain the meaning of file.
A file is a named location that stores information or data permanently. It is always stored in the storage device using a file name with primary and secondary name, which is separated by a “.”(DOT).

## What is Integrated Development Environment?
An IDE is a GUI-based software program. It is designed to help programmers build applications with all the needed programs and libraries.

## Explain the framework
The framework is a platform for making software applications. It provides the basis on which developers can build programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predetermined classes as well as functions. It can be used to process inputs, manage hardware, and interact with system software.Ruby on Rails, Django, Angular, Laravel

## What is an Interface?
The interface is similar to a class in Java, but it is a collection of abstract methods. A class can have more than one interface.

## Distinguish between constructor and method abstract class and interface
The difference between class and interface is:

| Abstract class	| Interface |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract class does not support inheritance. |	The interface supports multiple inheritances. |
| An abstract class would contain constructor.	| The interface does not contain a constructor. |
| An abstract class is declared using the “Abstract” keyword.	| The interface is declared using the “interface” keyword. |
| It can be used with all access modifiers.	| It can be used with only public access modifier. |

## What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class contains methods and variables which are a class instance.

## What is an abstract class? 
A class having an abstract keyword is called an abstract class.

## Define Cin and Cout
Cin and Cout are objects used for input and output files, respectively.

## List the types of constructors
1) parameterized constructor and 2) default constructor.

## List out different OOPS principles?
The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
1. Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.
2. Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.
3. It means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy.
4. Polymorphism, This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.

## Explain the various type of access modifiers
* Private: Visible to a particular class
* Public: Visible to the world
* Protected: Visible to specific package as well as subclass

## What do you mean by destructor?
Destructor is a class member function that deletes or destructs an object.

## Explain primary memory
Primary memory, RAM is the main memory of a computer which can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It stores temporary information until the process finishes its execution.

## What is s the primary difference between process and thread?
Process is called as a program which is in execution. Thread is a segment of a process, so; a process can have more than one threa

## What is the difference between compiler and interpreter?

## Distinguish between constructor and method

## What is artificial intelligence?  What is machine learning? What is deep learning?
