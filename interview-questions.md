# Myself questions 

## 1. Could you tell me about yourself and describe your background in brief?

Growing up I didn't have a concrete idea of what I wanted to study, but I was completely sure that will be something about science and engineering because I have always been curious, and with a love to resolve riddles. But, at the first, I chose the engineering of mines because my country has a big mining industry. However, I realized that it was not my passion. For what I started to study in parallel what I really wanted, passing from physics, chemistry and finally finding the love for the computing science. 

Before my graduation, I studied by myself two years of computer science, making little codes like automatizing the play of a video game, simples games like the hanged, etc. Until the moment that I found the AI, and I started to focus on these, provoking that I made my thesis about the image recognition and segmentation applied on the geology. 

After my graduation, I worked one year in a company developing AI solutions applied to mining, and I made too a project of video monitoring of a factory taking advantage of the security cameras, where I had to use OpenVino, to achieve real-time processing on CPU. 

And now, I took the desition to start formals studies about computer science, with the AI specialization, where I ask for a preparation year because I want to make stronger my skills, I prefer to take a little more time, but have solid background knowledge 

## 2. What type of work environment do you prefer?
I prefer an environment of fellowship, where if someone has more knowledge of something, he or she shares it with the community, with the goal that all the team can improve and give a better service to the customer. When I know something that could be of help to someone, I'm really glad to share it, I'm not searching to be the first if this means stopping the growth of others.

## 3. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations? / tell me one situation where...
 1. When I just moved here was a little stressful, I didn't speak too much English and less Hungarian. The first time I had to make a lot of bureaucratic. So I first collected all the things in a list, and I put all requirements. While I tried to make a support network, I knew some Chilean people who had some information and advice. Meanwhile, I started to speak as much English I could to train. Now, fortunately, I'm more used to Hungary and expressing myself 
 2. In one moment in the middle of a project, the customers said that they couldn't provide the hardware requirement of a GPU, and I had to apply a technology that I didn't know at this time, to allow real-time processing of AI models on CPU. At first, I tried to manage this by myself, and I was so stressed working all my day. But after I learned the power of communication, I explained the situation to my boss, and we set new dates together with the customer. Thanks to my workmates' advice, I found the necessary technologies, which saved me a lot of work. Finally, I could fulfill all project's goals and with a good customer feedback

## 4. Do you prefer working independently or on a team?
Although working alone can be more agile, I like to work in a team, since much greater things can be done and you can learn from your colleagues

## 5. hen you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?
1. If it's possible, I like to measure the projects and tasks with my team on what is important and what is urgent. In this way, I can start with the most important and urgent things, and going fulfilling the rest according on this rank. 
2. In parallel, I like to put myself dates of fulfillment. Hopefully, less than final fulfill date, for what, in case of having any problem or delay, to be able to report it and take some measurements so as not to fail with the delivery of the product and not fail with the customer

## 6. What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?
I'm constantly searching for new information and trying to be on a date with the advances. But in parallel to the general information, I was taking courses and tried to make my own projects. This year I meanly focused on improve my problem solving skills and incorporating essential things like Git and the handling of ubuntu 

## 7. What are your salary expectations?
I'm not here just for money, but a good salary would give me the opportunity of a better life and feel more comfortable. I would like at least 120 - 150k 

## 8. Why Are You Leaving Your Current Job?
R// Because I came to study a master in computer science. At the first, I had the opportunity of continuing working beside my studies, but I didn't want to take responsibilities without knowing if I could fulfill them and at this moment we had a gap of 6 hours, which made it harder. The first semester I spent a lot of time getting used to Hungary and making lines in governmental offices. But now I'm more confident and I'm ready to retake my work hours. 

## 9. Tell Me About a Time You Demonstrated Leadership Skills.
I was part of the student center at covid times in my university days. I formed a work team to manage student difficulties like the absence of internet connections, the necessity of a laptop for study, or problems with professors. I made a questionary for knowing the situation of all the mining faculty, estimating the necessary resources, and thus proposing a solution to the rector. We reached that our faculty gave scholarships to pay the internet of classmates with resources problem and that the university put to disposition computers to pass to some students during the pandemic.  I really liked the worked made 

## 10. What’s a Time You Disagreed With a Decision That Was Made at Work?
 1. In one moment, I found that we were trying to make a mineral recognition process with an inefficient algorithm, but our team leader proposed this. So, I searched about the state of art, and I asked for the opportunity to make a short presentation, where I exposed the new algorithm and why it could improve our actual work. At first, I was rejected by my team leader because I couldn't respond to some questions, but the next time I went more prepared, and I had a unanimous votation for change to the new method. After that, a collage helped to improve even my proposal, and I felt good about starting the transition. 
 2. Although, sometimes I couldn't change the thinking of my collages after searching for the background that supports my proposal. In these cases, after draining all my argumentation, I respected the team decision and I worked without problem in the chosen form 

## 11. Tell Me About a Time You Made a Mistake.
In one project I needed a GPU for the real-time processing of a model. My mistake was to start to develop the model without confirmation from the customer of the hardware disponibility because they said at the beginning that they can put what we would need. But almost at the final of my development, they said me that it was not possible, and they only have a CPU. So, I had to change the type of model and change the technologies used. In the beginning, I tried to manage this by myself, but I learned the power of communication, I told the problem to my boss and colleagues. With my boss, we talked with the customer and we update the new dates and my colleagues gave me advice for the new development. Finally, the project was delivered on the stipulated dates and with a good customer feedback

## 12. Tell Me About a Challenge or Conflict You’ve Faced at Work, and How You Dealt With It.
I had a team leader who constantly attacked the proposals in my former work. In the beginning, it was a little awkward, but I learned to don't take it personally, and I found like a good idea because after this, always when I wanted to propose something, I prepared myself better to respond to any question, and it made me have a stronger aproach

## 13. What is your greatest strength?

Until now, I reached long-term goals and things that looked so hard for someone from where I came, with parents only with high school, I studied in a public school, which is not the best in my country. But I achieved being one of the top 5 on my degree and won one of the fifteen scholarships for study in Hungary.  Where I was working for coming to Europe to study since I left the high school

## 14. What is your greatest weakness?
I'm a little anxious, for example,  when I'm waiting for a test result. But for this reason, I tried to keep myself occupied. In this way, I avoid overthinking and move on with my other task. I also do sport and mind fullness meditation to relax. I like introspection, and when I find a lousy behavior, I try to fix it.
